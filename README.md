**Surgical Inventory Data Sanitizer**
---

This project provides a robust Python-based pipeline for small businesses to clean, audit, and analyze messy inventory data. It moves beyond basic scripts by implementing statistical outlier detection and an interactive human-in-the-loop review process.


## Key Features

Automated Auditing: Scans for duplicates, missing values, and logical inconsistencies.

Statistical Outlier Detection: Uses the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify suspicious pricing dynamically.

Interactive Review: A CLI-based "Wizard" that allows users to approve or reject proposed data deletions row-by-row.

Audit Trail: Every deletion is recorded in a sanitization_log.csv with a reason and a timestamp.

Professional Reporting: Generates a multi-page PDF Business Report including:

Executive Summary Table.

Product Count by Category (Bar Chart).

Inventory Value Distribution (Pie Chart).

## Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.x

Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib

File Formats: CSV (Data/Logs), PDF (Reports)

## The Science: Outlier Detection

Instead of hard-coding price limits, this tool adapts to your data using the IQR Rule:

Q1: 25th percentile of prices.

Q3: 75th percentile of prices.

IQR: $Q3 - Q1$.

Bounds: Any price outside $[Q1 - 1.5 \times IQR, Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR]$ is flagged for review.

This ensures that if a store sells both $10 scalpels and $5,000 lasers, the tool doesn't accidentally delete valid expensive stock.
